# Issue tracker: GitHub

Issues and PRDs for this repo live as GitHub issues. Use the `gh` CLI for all operations.

## Conventions

- **Create an issue**: `gh issue create --title "..." --body "..."`. Use a heredoc for multi-line bodies.
- **Read an issue**: `gh issue view <number> --comments`, filtering comments by `jq` and also fetching labels.
- **List issues**: `gh issue list --state open --json number,title,body,labels,comments --jq '[.[] | {number, title, body, labels: [.labels[].name], comments: [.comments[].body]}]'` with appropriate `--label` and `--state` filters.
- **Comment on an issue**: `gh issue comment <number> --body "..."`
- **Apply / remove labels**: `gh issue edit <number> --add-label "..."` / `--remove-label "..."`
- **Close**: `gh issue close <number> --comment "..."`

Infer the repo from `git remote -v` — `gh` does this automatically when run inside a clone.

## Pull requests as a triage surface

**PRs as a request surface: no.** _(Set to `yes` if this repo treats external PRs as feature requests; `/triage` reads this flag.)_

When set to `yes`, PRs run through the same labels and states as issues, using the `gh pr` equivalents:

- **Read a PR**: `gh pr view <number> --comments` and `gh pr diff <number>` for the diff.
- **List external PRs for triage**: `gh pr list --state open --json number,title,body,labels,author,authorAssociation,comments` then keep only `authorAssociation` of `CONTRIBUTOR`, `FIRST_TIME_CONTRIBUTOR`, or `NONE` (drop `OWNER`/`MEMBER`/`COLLABORATOR`).
- **Comment / label / close**: `gh pr comment`, `gh pr edit --add-label`/`--remove-label`, `gh pr close`.

GitHub shares one number space across issues and PRs, so a bare `#42` may be either — resolve with `gh pr view 42` and fall back to `gh issue view 42`.

## Wayfinding operations

Wayfinder efforts keep their artifacts as GitHub issues:

- **The map** is an issue labeled `wayfinder:map` — one per effort, the index of its decisions.
- **Tickets** are child issues labeled `wayfinder:ticket` **plus** one type label (`wayfinder:grilling` / `wayfinder:prototype` / `wayfinder:research` / `wayfinder:task`), carrying a `## Map` section (`Part of #<map>`) in the body.
- **Blocking** uses this repo's existing body convention — a `## Blocked by` section listing issue numbers. GitHub-native issue dependencies are not used. A ticket is unblocked when every listed issue is closed.
- **Claiming**: assign yourself (`gh issue edit <n> --add-assignee @me`) before any work. Open + unassigned = unclaimed.
- **The frontier**: `gh issue list --label "wayfinder:ticket" --state open --json number,title,body,assignees,labels`, then keep issues with no assignee whose `## Blocked by` entries are all closed.
- **Resolving**: post the answer as a comment, close the issue, append one line to the map's `## Decisions so far`.
